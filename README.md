**Makao** is a polish equivalent of **Macau** - a Hungarian card game, where players play a single card in sequence in a manner similar to Uno. Unlike Uno, however, Makaó is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. Makaó also involves bluffing so that the players do not necessarily have to play a card if they wish to save it for higher points later. Cheating is encouraged in order to make gameplay more varied and enjoyable. Source: Wikipedia
